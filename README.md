# predicting-early-stage-alzheimers-diagnosis
Predicting diagnosis of early-stage Alzheimer's disease using Machine Learning models such as Random Forest. 

## Overview
- This project is motivated by the real world problem of Alzheimer's disease detection. Alzheimer’s is a disease with no known cure that causes a progressive memory decline—leading to dementia, overall cognitive function decline, and hindrance to one’s ability to function in everyday situations. Consequently, it is important to be able to diagnose Alzheimer’s
in its early stages. In this project, we developed a predictive classification model using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to determine whether an individual is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s using a dataset containing patient medical information. Following data preprocessing on the raw data and data model tuning, this Random Forest algorithm achieved high accuracy and reliability for predicting whether a patient is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Analytical results were communicated thorugh text as well as visual models.
